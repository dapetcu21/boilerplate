# Boilerplate

My own frontend boilerplate for a [React]/[Redux] project.

Uses [Webpack] for packaging. [Babel] is configured with [stage-0] (ES6+ES7) and [JSX] support. CSS is passed through [SaSS] and [autoprefixer].

The [Redux dev tools][redux-devtools] are built in and hot reload is configured for reducers and React components.

# Usage

`npm start` to start watching with [webpack-dev-server]

`npm run build` to build for production
